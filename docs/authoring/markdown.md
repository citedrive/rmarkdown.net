# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for writing and formatting text in a simple and easy-to-read way. Here are the basic elements of Markdown syntax:

## Headings

To create headings, use the pound symbol (#) followed by a space and the heading text. The number of pound symbols determines the heading level, with one pound symbol for the highest level (H1) and six pound symbols for the lowest level (H6). For example:

```md
# H1 Heading 
## H2 Heading 
### H3 Heading 
#### H4 Heading 
##### H5 Heading 
###### H6 Heading
```

## Emphasis

To add emphasis to text, use asterisks (*) for italic or double asterisks (**) for bold. For example:

```md
*This text is in italic* 
**This text is bold**
```

## Lists

To create lists, use asterisks (*) for unordered lists and numbers followed by a period (.) for ordered lists. For example:



Unordered list: 
```md
* Item 1 
* Item 2 
* Item 3 
``` 
Ordered list: 
```md
1. First item 
2. Second item 
3. Third item
``` 


## Links

To create links, enclose the link text in square brackets [] and the URL in parentheses (). For example:

lessCopy code

`[Link text](https://www.example.com)`

## Images

To add images, use the exclamation point (!) followed by square brackets with the image description and the URL in parentheses. For example:

lessCopy code

`![Image description](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)`

## Code

To insert code into your document, use a single backtick (`) for inline code or triple backticks (```) for code blocks. For example:

lessCopy code

``Inline code: `code`  Code block:``

Code block

sqlCopy code
