# Authoring in Quarto / R Mardkwon documents

This section explains how to create and write documents with the Quarto and R Markdown frameworks. Formatting, creating tables and charts, embedding images and multimedia, and using R code chunks to perform data analysis and visualization within the document are all covered. This category is ideal for people who want to learn how to use these tools to create dynamic, reproducible reports and presentations.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
